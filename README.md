# scraping

To use

1 - In the sporting-life-href.js file, enter your database link in "this.database"
2 - In the sporting-life-href.js file, enter the brands names (in the Sporting Chek format) in the array "this.brands"
3 - Run: "npm run nightwatch" in the command line

Note: not all brands have a "shop-all" url on Sport Chek, only the ones with a lot of articles. So entering a non valid brand will break the code.
